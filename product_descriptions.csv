L'Oreal Elvive Clay Oily Roots Shampoo 400ml

The Science of Oily Roots and Dry Ends.

Oil produced from the scalp can build up causing the roots to become visibly greasy, weighing down the hair. Over-washing to combat this problem can strip the fiber leaving it dry. This results in a vicious cycle of washing. What if you could have hair that was cared for at both ends?

The Secret of Clay for 72 Hours of Pure Roots and Hydrated Ends.

For the first time, L'Oréal Paris Laboratories have combined 3 Refined Clays to create its first re-balancing range revealing perfectly balanced, beautiful hair.
 

Scalp feels deeply purified for 72 hours with freshness and light, lifted root.
Dry hair feels hydrated right to the ends for fluid, free-flowing lengths.
Revitalises the hair with softness, shine and bounce.    
A delicate Clay texture for hair purity, hydration and beauty.


	 

Proven Results:

Visibly clears dandruff for intensely purified roots, hydrated feeling ends.Perfectly balanced, beautiful hair.

Alpecin Caffeine Shampoo 375ml Alpecin Caffeine shampoo is now available in a bigger bottle! Using Alpecin Caffeine shampoo daily provides the hair roots with the active ingredient. It is recommended to leave the shampoo on the hair for at least two minutes so that all the caffeine can be absorbed into the scalp. The longer it is left the more caffeine can be absorbed. Men’s skin is more sensitive than women’s skin. This is due to the male hormone testosterone – it makes men’s skin less robust and weakens its natural protective function significantly.




How to use
Application: Massage into the hair roots and leave on the hair for two minutes before rinsing out.Use daily.


Important info

Freshly bleached hair looks bright and beautiful, but over time it can go brassy, leaving you with unwanted yellow tones that alter your blonde. Take control of your blonde and own your tone with the Lee Stafford Bleach Blondes Purple Toning Shampoo. A crucial colour corrector for bleached to natural blondes, this powerful purple toning shampoo contains violet pigment to knock out pesky yellow tones and brassiness to keep your hair looking bright, vibrant and salon fresh. 
Purple sits directly opposite yellow on the colour wheel. This means the purple pigment within our violet formulations helps to knock out unwanted brassiness, for a more balanced blonde. Use this shampoo whenever hair looks overly warm for a speedy colour refresh. 
A nourishing formula with Pro-Vitamin B5, Chamomile and Moringa Seed Extract (also known as the  'miracle tree') to encourage natural shine. Formulated specifically for bleached, balayaged, naturally light blonde or highlighted hair, you can team this shampoo with the Lee Stafford Purple Toning Conditioner for double the toning power, or use with the Everyday Care Conditioner for salon fresh blonde.

Freshly bleached hair looks bright and beautiful but can discolour and go warm and brassy over time. Take control of your blonde and cool down your colour. Refresh your blonde with the Lee Stafford Bleach Blondes Ice White Toning Shampoo. This indigo-blue shampoo is a crucial colour corrector, created to cool down your tone and neutralise orange tones and brassiness in blonde hair.

This nourishing formulation with Pro-Vitamin B5, Chamomile and Moringa Seed Extract (aka Miracle Tree) encourages natural shine.

Recharge your red. Our Red Boosting Shampoo, with Pomegranate Extract & Vitamin E, gently protects, preserves & enhances red shades to extend the life of your red colour.For red hair that shines with health, the Red Boosting Shampoo also contains 18-MEA Technology. 18-MEA is a natural part of the hair’s structure and can be stripped away in the colouring and lightening process. 18-MEA provides a natural water-repelling barrier to the surface of the hair; without it, damaged hair may not attract the oils it needs.
